## About me

Programming has long been one of my favorite hobbies. Now I'm trying to turn this old hobby of mine into a profession.

I am a Geek Brains student specializing in development. This is my training repository.

This is where I store my completed study projects. In addition, I publish my work done between classes.

From time to time I tried to program in different languages, but I always returned to my cherished love - Ð¡Sharp. Do not count how many sleepless nights we spent together)) Therefore, most of the projects here will be in this language.
